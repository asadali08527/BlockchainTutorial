# BlockchainTutorial using Java

This tutorial is intended to build a picture of how one could develop blockchain technology.  To understand the concept step by step, 
one need to go through each package. each package has been numbered/named with one , two, three and so on. You just need to go through 
each in ordered way. Note- each package consist of one concept. for example package com.cryptoride.noobs.one deals with creation of your first basic ‘blockchain’. and package com.cryptoride.noobs.two deals with 
another level concept called "Proof Of Work".

While writing this tutorial I assume that you have a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming. 
### Environment-
+ Java and JDK installed.
+ Eclipse ( or any other IDE/Text Editor ).
+ Maven
#### Dependency
GSON library by google. This will allow us to turn an object into Json. It’s a super useful library that we will also be using further.
